                    &quot;Zero&quot; by the Smashing Pumpkins and J.D. Salinger&apos;s novel &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; are both<br>
                    portrayals of the struggle of alienation, the yearning for connection and the pain of <br>
                    disillusionment. While the two pieces of media are aesthetically very different their themes <br>
                    resonate to an incredible degree. &quot;My reflection, dirty mirror / There&apos;s no connection to myself /<br>
                    I&apos;m your lover, I&apos;m your zero / I&apos;m the face in your dreams of glass.&quot; These lyrics mirror the <br>
                    general themes of isolation and alienation that hold exemplifies. The image of Holden, standing <br>
                    before a large mirror, staring at an alternative version of himself, someone who is socially adept<br>
                    and does not struggle with being so isolated from society. Yet, his figure in front of the mirror,<br>
                    accentuates his reality, alone and desolate. The disconnect between what he wants and reality <br>
                    emphasizes the gap between what he wants for his life and what he has experienced. The singer<br>
                    says &quot;She&apos;s the one for me / She&apos;s all I really need&quot;, these lyrics echo the unfulfilled connection<br>
                    that characterizes Holden through the novel, him being in love with Jane Gallagher. The image<br>
                    of the tennis racket and the checkerboard are physical representations of Jane in Holden&apos;s life.<br>
                    The lyrics &quot;Emptiness is loneliness, and loneliness is cleanliness / And cleanliness is godliness,<br>
                    and God is empty / Just like me&quot; resonate with Holden&apos;s Disillusionment with the adult world. <br>
                    The image of Holden standing alone in a white barren room contrasted by a colorful outside <br>
                    world represents the contrast between what he perceives as a fake, phony adult world which he<br>
                    inhabits, versus, the world of childhood that he desires to return to and protect.<br>
